                            further processing is necessary as stipulated in Art. 17 Para. 3 GDPR, to restrict said processing
                            per Art. 18 GDPR;

                        Art. 16, 17 Para. 1, 18 GDPR. However, this obligation does not apply if such notification is impossible
                        or involves a disproportionate effort. Nevertheless, users have a right to information about these
                        recipients.

                            GDPR. In particular, an objection to data processing for the purpose of direct advertising is

                    <p class="text">The data will be deleted within no more than seven days, unless continued
                        storage is required for evidentiary purposes. In which case, all or part of the data will be excluded
                        from deletion until the investigation of the relevant incident is finally resolved.

                        your personal account. If you interact by clicking Like, Share, etc., this information can be stored
                        your personal user account and possibly posted on the respective network. To prevent this, you need to
                        log out of your social media account before clicking on the graphic. The various social media networks
                        also offer settings that you can configure accordingly.
