                        <p class="text">In the first semester of my master studies I took a course in Natural Language
                            Processing. My exam performance was to work on a project that dealt with natural language
                            processing. My project partner and I decided to investigate the use of NLP in a real
                            business use case. Since I'm a big fan of movies, we wanted to use natural language to
                            emulate a feature of streaming services. We needed a large amount of textual data of many
                            movies as a data base. We finally wanted to research if it is possible to cluster movies
                            based on their story using textual data as suggest similar movies within a cluster.
                        </p>
                        <p class="text">We have divided our project into four sections, which I would like to explain
                            in more detail below.</p>
                        <h2 style="padding-top: 2.5vh;"><span style="color: #DCDCDC;">#</span> Crawling</h2>
                        <p class="text">My project partner was responsible for crawling data. We used IMDB's film
                            database, specifically the <a href="https://www.imdb.com/chart/top/?ref_=nv_mv_250"
                                style="color: #2F58F7">250 best
                                rated films</a>, as a data basis. My project partner has
                            written an algorithm that crawls all movies in this list and writes important information
                            into a JSON file. We cralwed the name of a film, its synopsis and some more meta data. We
                            used <code>Scrapy</code> as a Python module for crawling websites and links. I won't go into
                            detail
                            here because my project partner did most of the work. The resulting JSON file looked like
                            the following data structure.
                        </p>
                        <pre class="prettyprint text fact">
                        <code class="lang-json">
    [
        {
            "title": "The Shawshank Redemption",
            "date": "1994",
            "rank": "1",
            "synopsis": "In 1947, Andy Dufresne ...",
        },
        ...
    ]</code>
                </pre>
                        <h2 style="padding-top: 2.5vh;"><span style="color: #DCDCDC;">#</span> Validation</h2>
                        <p class="text">After crawling the data, it was necessary to validate the data to ensure its
                            correctness. For this purpose I performed an analysis of the data and made first tests to
                            process the data. From then on we used the module <code>Pandas</code> as data structure,
                            which gave us a
                            lot of possibilities to analyze and process the data. After all data entries of the JSON
                            file were successfully transferred into a Pandas DataFrame, further information concerning
                            the data could be obtained. For example, 13 movies had to be removed because they did not
                            contain a summary of the content. It was also interesting to note that each summary of a
                            movie
                            had an average of 2030 tokens. Here all punctuation marks and stop words etc. were included.
                            These included information irrelevant for movie plots.
                            Removing the punctuation marks, stop words, named entities and verbs could reduce the data
                            by 76 %. The average
                            number of tokens was then 502. A
                            reduction of the tokens also allowed a reduction of the
                            standard deviation of the word count from 1792 to 436.</p>

                        <p class="text">An analysis of the most frequently used words was also conducted. In the
                            following picture the 20 most frequently used words of all processed films are visualized.
                            Interestingly, men are mentioned significantly more often than women, for example. In
                            addition to the processed film data, all raw data was examined as well as proper names,
                            places, etc.</p>

                        <p class="text">After analyzing the data and trying out modules for processing the data, all
                            films were processed uniformly in order to obtain only content-relevant information/tokens.
                            In the following code snippet is my final algorithm for preprocessing all movie synopsis
                            data with the NLP module <code>spaCy</code>. This approach gave us the best results too. We
                            only use nouns and adjectives as
                            plot relevant information. Verbs, proper names are typically to genereal in its basic form
                            and stopp
                            words or punctuation didn't contain plot relevant information.</p>
                        <pre class="prettyprint text fact">
                        <code class="lang-json">
    for index, movie in data.iterrows():
        processed_data.append({'title': movie['title'], 
            'bow': ' '.join([str(token.lemma_).lower() 
            for token in nlp(movie['synopsis']) if 
            not token.ent_type_ and not token.is_stop and 
            not token.is_punct and token.pos_ != 'VERB'])})
    data = pd.DataFrame(processed_data)</code>
                        </pre>
                        <p class="text">For this I iterate through the Pandas DataFrame of the raw film data. For each
                            film I create a new DataFrame entry, which contains a bag of words of relevant tokens. With
                            the help of Python's list comprehension all tokens of a movie summary are appended to a
                            list, which are not proper names, stop words, punctuation marks and verbs. For example "The
                            Shawshank Redemption"s bag of words now contains only words like: banker, wife, lover,
                            golf, pro, state, death, penalty ...</p>
                        <h2 style="padding-top: 2.5vh;"><span style="color: #DCDCDC;">#</span> Clustering</h2>
                        <p class="text">Before a cluster analysis could be performed, it was necessary to convert all
                            data into a suitable form for the input of the algorithm. For this purpose I created a
                            feature matrix, where each movie's data contained a vector of all unique words of all movie
                            summaries and.
                            For each word the frequency of use is stored in the respective summary by means
                            of the inverse-document-frequency. We get 237 film entries with 196 normalized frequencies
                            of the tokens/words each.</p>
                        <p class="text">As cluster algorithm a k-Means algorithm from <code>Scikit-Learn</code> was
                            used. In a test
                            run the algorithm was executed for 2 to n - 1 clusters. With the help of a metric, the
                            within-cluster sum-of-squares, it was evaluated which number of clusters would allow a
                            reasonable distribution. A final number of 7 clusters was chosen. The most relevant tokens
                            for the allocation to a cluster as well as some associated movies are shown below.</p>

                        <p class="text">The results of this cluster analysis should now be used to make a prediction of
                            similar titles. This functionality is modelled on the recommendation of similar titles for
                            further viewing, as known from Netflix, for example. I used the cosine similarity to
                            determine the similarity of movies based on their bag of words. Only films of one cluster
                            were compared to each other. Since all movies still have the same amount of tokens, a
                            min-max normalization was applied to distinguish differences in similarities more clearly.
                            For example, a user who has seen Inception will next receive The Truman Show as a
                            suggestion, because it
                            has a normalized similarity of 93,4 %. This makes sense since both movies describe
                            simulations of reality.
